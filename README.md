### 🌠 Welcome to my GitHub profile 🌠

## Introduction 👨‍💻
I'm Filip & I am currently working at [lfda.de](https://lfda.de) doing web development.
I was also working at Dataport as a DevOps Engineer prior, where I learned a lot about managing applications on Kubernetes.

Now I am trying to advocate for containers & especially Kubernetes whenever I get asked about anything 😁

## What you can expect to see here ⏳
Usually I'd love to try out new things and publisher everything here, however, the day only has a finite amount of hours, and if you start subtracting the time it takes to do the usual chores...
yeah. 

So, I am currently sitting on *at least* three projects that I want to publisher once everything is tidied up and pretty.

To give you something like a small teaser:

* Vanilla Kubernetes on Hetzner Cloud using Terraform & Ansible
* custom auto-approving CSR controller for clusters running on Hetzner Cloud (will probably be named `hcloud-csr-controller` or something similar)
* *some other secret project...* 🤫

I am currently planning to work on those in this exact order. However, I might not. Who knows.. this is not work & I am just trying to have fun developing on my own terms to clear my head 🙂

That being said, back to tinkering. Have a nice one! 🍻😏
