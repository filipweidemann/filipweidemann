### 🌠 Welcome to my GitHub profile 🌠

## Introduction 👨‍💻
I'm Filip & I am currently working at [lfda.de](https://lfda.de) doing web development.
I was also working at Dataport as a DevOps Engineer prior, where I learned a lot about managing applications on Kubernetes.

Now I am trying to advocate for containers & especially Kubernetes whenever I get asked about anything 😁

## What you can expect to see here ⏳
Kubernetes, Python, and broader Frontend stuff probably.
